# FaceSense 🚀

**FaceSense** is an AI-powered Android application that performs real-time facial expression analysis using Google’s ML Kit. It detects multiple faces in a frame and provides detailed expression metrics such as smile percentage, eye openness, and facial landmarks — all processed on-device for speed and privacy.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of FaceSense is to provide an interactive, privacy-focused tool that enables users to analyze facial expressions in real-time without uploading data to the cloud. Ideal for social apps, education, personal reflection, and wellness tracking.

## ⚡ Key Features

- ✅ Detect multiple faces in a camera frame.
- ✅ Real-time expression analysis (Smile %, Left & Right Eye Openness).
- ✅ Visual graphical representation of analyzed data.
- ✅ Intuitive and clean user interface.
- ✅ Privacy ensured: All processing happens on-device.
- ✅ Fast and responsive user interaction.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Android Studio (Kotlin)
- Google ML Kit Face Detection API
- CameraX (Camera interface)
- Jetpack Compose (UI Design)
- TensorFlow Lite (Under the hood of ML Kit)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Camera captures video frames.
2. ML Kit detects faces and facial landmarks (Eyes, Nose, Mouth).
3. Expression metrics (Smile %, Eye openness) are calculated.
4. All processing happens in real-time, fully on-device.
5. Expression data is displayed visually on the app screen.
